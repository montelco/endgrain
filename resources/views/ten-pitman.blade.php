@section('body')
  <p style="font-size: 16pt">After months of sleepless nights considering the option and taking the time to hash out details, Jeo Fultano, owner of Endgrain Coffee bar was able to say that the hard work had paid off. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EndgrainCoffee/posts/2299869843599906" about="_blank">Taking to the Endgrain Coffee Bar Facebook page</a>, Joe announced that the deal was official as of February 28.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 16pt">Pictured here, Joe had signed the papers on the original Second Ave location. Four years ago to the day, the Pitman community were first introduced to Endgrain Coffee Bar. Now, four years on, Endgrain is looking to grow by providing to community with a larger cafe space.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 16pt">Joe stated on the Endgrain Facebook that, "This new space will not only allow us to have a much larger cafe but we will also move the roasting operation into the new space as well." With more cafe space and more space to allow for roasting, Endgrain will be taking fresh roasted coffee to the next level by having roasting just feet away from space where Endgrain's incredible team of baristas will be preparing each customer's coffee drinks.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 16pt">Of course, Joe hasn't been at it alone. He took the time to thank his family, his awesome staff, and Endgrain's hugely loyal customers for believing and for coming back time and again.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 16pt">As with any undertaking, Joe acknowledged that there's lots of work ahead but reassured his customers and the community that updates will be frequent.</p>
