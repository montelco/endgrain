          <h3>Cold Brewed Coffee</h3>
          <p>The sweeter brother of iced coffee, cold brewed coffee never touches hot water which means that it's not bitter. The cold brewing process imbues rich, chocolatey notes and makes for a refreshing treat for your guests. Even if your guests take some coffee with their cup of cream, they'll be able to drink our sweet cold brew black.</p>

          <h3>Nitro Cold Brewed Coffee</h3>
          <p>It looks like Guiness, tastes like goodness. Our Nitro Cold Brewed coffee takes cold brew to the next level by being pressured with nitrogen for over twenty-four hours, giving it a bubbly, creamy taste. You'll have guests lining up for more after they try their first glass of our Nitro Cold Brewed coffee.</p>

          <h3>Batch Brewed Coffee</h3>
          <p>They call classics 'classic' for a reason: because there's nothing wrong with 'em. Batch brewed coffee is always a crowd pleaser and with our selection of locally roasted beans from which to choose, you can bet on guests begging for more.</p>
