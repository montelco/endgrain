						<p>Craftmanship is a work we use a lot at Franks Shoe Service, but that’s because we live by it. When we were founded in 1935, craftsmanship meant that you took your time to make sure that every stitch was picture perfect- not mass produced and cold. We take our time to speak with you to ensure we fix every problem while we have your shoes. It’s not about “bottom lines” or “profit margins;” it’s about providing a service that helps get you places.</p>
						<p>In a world that is fast-paced and mass-produced, it’s nice to be able to step out of that for a minute and enjoy the smaller things. In the modern world we seldom get to speak with the men and women that actually provide services to us. There’s something refreshing about speaking with the person that’s fixing your shoes; it gives you a sense of comfort- that you’ll be well taken care of. Modern shoe repair is more than craftsman quality work and friendly customer service- it’s about being convenient and flexible. For us that means using the technology at our fingertips. Whether it’s eReceipts, loyalty cards, Apple Pay, Android Pay, or Facebook/Foursquare promotions, we’re using all the technology we can in order to make being a Franks Shoe Service customer a unique and enjoyable experience.</p>

						<!-- {{-- @yield('aboutus') --}} -->
						<p>Our story starts in Reggio Calabria, Italy when Francesco “Frank” Monteleone started as a shoe cobbler in 1933. He worked hard, even as a young man. He took pride in his work and was a flourishing businessman, but he felt called to become an American. With that, he took a boat to America and settled in New York City. After setting up shop and finding success in the big city, his friend wrote him about coming to southern New Jersey.  He met a girl in New Jersey, set up shop nearby, and lived the American dream- two children, a gorgeous wife, and a successful business.</p>
						<!--<p>After passing in 2009, we decided to keep the business going. Now led by his great-grandson, Cory Monteleone, and his grandson, Richard Monteleone, Franks Shoe Service is moving into the next generation of shoe repair. By paying respect to our past, we are making our patriarch proud. We care about our customers and we accept nothing but complete customer satisfaction and our hope is that you can experience for yourself the kind of customer service that Frank provided to his customers.</p> -->
